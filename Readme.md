**Overview**

This is my attempt at building a small library to solve selected problems in [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net). I've chosen to write my solutions in Ruby in order to improve my skills in this language, as opposed to any mathematical or performance-related reasons.

**What is Project Euler?**

Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

The motivation for starting Project Euler, and its continuation, is to provide a platform for the inquiring mind to delve into unfamiliar areas and learn new concepts in a fun and recreational context.
